# Python for Everyone

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mike-matera/python-for-everyone/release-sp23?urlpath=lab)

Learn Python with help and practice. These [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks support my [CIS-15](https://www.lifealgorithmic.com/cis-15/index.html) class at [Cabrillo College](https://www.cabrillo.edu/). The notebooks teach the principles of programming with activities that give you practice and projects to challenge you.

## Using the Notebooks

It has never been easier to use this course content. Just click the "Binder" badge at the top of this page. The notebooks load with all of the lessons and labs ready to go. Binder sessions aren't saved but you can download individual notebooks to your computer and re-upload them to Binder next time.
