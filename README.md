# Python for Everyone

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mike-matera/python-for-everyone/main?urlpath=lab)

Learn Python with help and practice. These [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
notebooks support my [CIS-15](https://www.lifealgorithmic.com/cis-15/index.html)
class at [Cabrillo College](https://www.cabrillo.edu/). The notebooks teach the
principles of programming with activities that give you practice and projects to
challenge you.

## Using the Notebooks

It has never been easier to use this course content. Just click the "Binder"
badge at the top of this page. The notebooks load with all of the lessons and
labs ready to go. Binder sessions aren't saved but you can download individual
notebooks to your computer and re-upload them to Binder next time.
