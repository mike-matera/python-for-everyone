    "## The Monty Hall Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The game show starts with three doors. Behind one of them is a car. Behind the other two are goats. Monty asks you to choose a door. For argument's sake let's say you choose door number 1. Then Monty opens a different door to reveal a goat. \n",

    "Monty then asks you, \"would you like to keep the door you chose or switch doors?\" The problem is a paradox because most people (even some with a Ph.D.) think that the odds of guessing right are 50/50. They're not, you have better odds if you switch. "

Random numbers that are good for things like games and random numbers that are good for cryptography. Cryptographic random numbers are so random it's very difficult to guess them, but they take time to generate. The `random` package has random numbers that are good for games. \n",
