    "\n",
    "The Python calculator is a program that asks the user for two numbers then computes various mathematical operations on those numbers. The output of the program is HTML, which will be nicely formatted by Jupyter. Starter code is provided and you should only add code and not remove any lines. The starter code has instructions that I haven't taught yet, here's a quick summary of what it does:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These statements ask the user for input when you run your program you will see the prompts at the bottom of the Python cell. Enter numbers into the prompts and they will be assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. We'll talk about taking input from the user next week. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "  1. Addition (`+`)\n",
    "  2. Subtraction (`-`)\n",
    "  3. Multiplication (`*`)\n",
    "  4. Division (`/`)\n",
    "  5. Modululs (`%`)\n",
    "  6. Less than (`<`)\n",
    "  7. Greater than (`>`)\n",
    "  8. Equal to (`==`)\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example, if a user enters the numbers `12` and `56` the program generates an HTML table that looks like this: \n",

    "  - Your program must generate HTML \n",
    "  - Your table must have a header row as shown in the example.\n",
    "  - You must perform all of the operations shown. \n",
    "    - I will test your code with random numbers, you must actually do the math! \n",
